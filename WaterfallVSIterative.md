# Waterfall VS Interative Approaches to Software Development
 
## Waterfall Model
 
The waterfall model was originally defined by Winston W. Royce in the1970s. attempts to complete each phase before moving to the next but has built-in feedback loops which allow you to return to a previous phase if you discover problems. 
The phases contain progress flows similar to a waterfall cascading down a hill, hence the name.

### Phases of Waterfall Model

1. Requirements Analysis 
2. Design 
3. Implementation 
4. Testing 
5. Maintenance 

### Pros
1. Design errors are identified and captured early
2. Measuring progress is easy due to well-defined milestones
3. Accurate cost estimates can be provided, even for large projects.

### Cons
1. Considerable administrative overhead for changes
2. Unrealistic assumption regarding no future possibility of requirement changes
3. Unmet deadlines due to many unknowns during the project timeline
