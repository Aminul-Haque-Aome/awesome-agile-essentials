### Definitions

A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.
[[Source: The Scrum Guide™](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)]

### Key Points

- Scrum is lightweight, simple to understand yet difficult to master [[Reference](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)]
- Scrum is a framework for getting work done, where agile is a mindset [[Reference](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum)]
- Scrum is a framework, not a method for effective software delivery and building products 
- The Scrum Framework, being a type of agile software development, implements the core values defined by the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/):
  1. Individuals and interactions OVER processes and tools
  2. Working software OVER comprehensive documentation
  3. Customer collaboration OVER contract negotiation
  4. Responding to change OVER following a plan
- No two teams adopt SCRUM the same way, but all of them should adhere to the rules and values of SCRUM

### SCRUM Theory 

- Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism [[Reference](https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf)]
- In philosophy, empiricism is a theory that states that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience
- The values behind Scrum are heavily influenced by 3 pillars of Empirical Process Control which are -
  1. Transparency
  2. Inspection
  3. Adaptation
  
### SCRUM Values

1. Commitment:  Each member of the team then commits to delivering on decided timeline
2. Openness: The team members must be open so that the process can be inspected and improved transparently
3. Courage: The team members must be couragous in case of individual mistakes
4. Focus: Each team needs to commit to focus on delivering a set of outcomes
5. Respect: Having respect for team members in times of conflict is necessary

### SCRUM Events

1. The Sprint: A short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work
2. Sprint Planning: The act of planning of what-to-do and how-to-do the sprint tasks
3. Daily Scrum: A 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to reflect on the work progress 
4. Sprint Review: Event to inspect the Increment/Sprint Goals and adapt the Product Backlog, if required
5. Sprint Retrospective: An event, to be occurred after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning, to inspect and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint

### SCRUM Artifacts

1. Product Backlog: The master list of features, requirements, enhancements, and fixes
2. Sprint Backlog: The list of items selected for implementation in the current sprint cycle
3. Increment (or, Sprint Goal): The usable end-product from a sprint 

### The SCRUM Team

1. A Product Owner: Responsible for managing the Product Backlog
2. A Scrum Master: Responsible for promoting and applying Scrum by promoting Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values
3. The Development Team: Responsible for creating the Increment & achieving the Sprint Goal

"In essence, I am saying that Scrum fails when those in the named roles fail to live up to the role. This can also include cases where a role isn’t named or when someone or more than one person steps-up into that role. But in either case, if those mindsets are not present on the team it is a recipe for failure."
